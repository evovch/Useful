1. You can just run the code as a macro using

$ root -l PDF_CDF.C

2. You can compile the code using ACLiC

$ root -l PDF_CDF.C+

Afterwards you can use the dynamic library, i.e.

$ root -l
> .L PDF_CDF_C.so
> PDF_CDF()

In this solution it takes some time to compile but program works much faster,
which is feasible for time-consuming computations and multiple invocations without recompiling.

3. You can compile the code using standard C++ compiler into a single executable.
For that you need to reference the include and lib files. See Makefile for details.

$ make

Afterwards you can use this executable without direct invocation of ROOT but using the dynamic libraries of ROOT.
In principle this should be the fastest working solution, theoretically just a bit faster than the previous one.
Try running your exe without setting the ROOT environment (without running thisroot.sh beforehand).
You must the error about absence of some dynamic library (*.so) from the ROOT package.
