There are 3 sets of figures which have different scales on the 'value' axis: 4 (from -4 T to 4 T), 2m (from -0.002 T to 0.002 T) and autoscale.
Each of these sets contains 3 animations: Bx, By and Bz components of the magnetic field vector.

1) To get the overall picture I kept a version where the Z axis of the 2D-histogram (magnetic field value) is adjusted automatically from the minimum and maximum values detected in the histo.

2) The more natural way is to keep the scale constant over all sections. For that a made a version with -4 to 4 span.

3) As we are mostly interested in the area inside the RICH magnetic shielding box, I created aslo a version with a rather small scale (from -0.002 T to 0.002 T). White bins correspond to place where the value is outside of this range.
